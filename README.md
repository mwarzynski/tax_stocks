# tax_stocks

Application computes the profits (and losses) for stocks transactions and dividends for particular fiscal year.

Polish translation (for SEO): aplikacja liczÄ…ca podatek od akcji i dywidend.

## Why?

Most of the applications which provide stock trading functionality for retail traders generate the tax forms automatically.
At least it is the case if you are a citizen of one of the bigger countries with higher customer concentration.
I am a Polish citizen and for me neither Degiro nor Revolut prepares the tax form related to stock profits (or losses).

Have you ever tried to manually evaluate taxes for the stock trades?
It is extremely repetitive process to say the least, therefore I've decided to automate it.

**Disclaimer: there is NO assurance this application works correctly.**

There are certain assumptions hardcoded in the code.
 - polish tax law rules are hardcoded (e.g. 19% income tax, no long-term capital gains)
 - exchange rates based on National Bank of Poland
 - the only supported currencies are USD, EUR and PLN

## Supported platforms

Current implementation supports two platforms: Revolut and Degiro.
Transactions providers are implemented behind an interface,
therefore adding implementation for other platforms should be relatively easy.

Application uses following code structure to keep the CSV files fairly organised: `data/investing/{platform}/{year}.csv`.

### Degiro

 1. Log in to the `Degiro` through Web Browser,
 2. Activity (left panel) -> Account Statement,
 3. Select "start date" and "end date" which contain all transactions,
 4. Export (CSV),
 5. Save downloaded file to `data/investing/degiro/{year}.csv`.

### Revolut

 1. Open `Revolut` application,
 2. Go to `Stocks` section,
 3. Click on `...` button next to `+ Add money`,
 4. Choose `Statements`,
 5. Change format to `Excel`,
 6. Select "starting on" and "ending on" dates to include full fiscal year (e.g. January 2021 -> December 2021),
 7. Click on "Get statement",
 8. Download the statement and convert to CSV,
 9. Save converted file to  `data/investing/revolut/{year}.csv`.

## How to run

Firstly you need to save the transactions from the platforms you use (instruction above).

```
$ ls -al data/investing/degiro
.rw-r--r--     0 mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  .keep
.rw-r--r--    1k mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  2020.csv
.rw-r--r--    1k mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  2021.csv
$ ls -al data/investing/revolut
.rw-r--r--     0 mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  .keep
.rw-r--r--    1k mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  2020.csv
.rw-r--r--    1k mwarzynski  2 Jan 00:00  2021.csv
```

If you already have the data, then it's sufficient to run the script as follows:
```
$ python main.py
tax_stocks: computes the profits (and losses) for stocks transactions and dividends for particular fiscal year.
Example: python main.py 2020

$ python main.py 2020
Year: 2020
